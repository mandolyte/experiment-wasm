# Attempting to make a WASM component and publish to NPM

**NOTE**: testing with stackblitz:
https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-wa3lmu?file=package.jso

- created this folder: `mkdir pretty-print-go-wasm`

- created go.mod:

```sh
$ cd pretty-print-go-wasm
$ go mod init github.com/mandolyte/pretty-print-go-wasm
go: creating new go.mod: module github.com/mandolyte/pretty-print-go-wasm
$ cat go.mod
module github.com/mandolyte/pretty-print-go-wasm

go 1.20
$
```

- created main.go in `src` folder(just copied from the webassembly-part-1 folder)

- compiled to wasm:
```sh
$ GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o main.wasm
```

- copied the go `wasm-exec.js` file in `src` (comes with go install; see tutorial)

- created the "wrapper" Javascript code in `src/index.js`

- created package.json with what I think will be needed

- run "npm install"; had some warnings, but seemed to work.

- run "npm publish":

```sh
$ npm publish

> pretty-print-json-go-wasm@0.1.0 prepublishOnly
> rm -fr ./dist & babel ./src --out-dir ./dist -s inline

Successfully compiled 2 files with Babel (193ms).

# Trials and Tribulations

## 2023-07-23

Since the NPM component is unable to locate the WASM file within itself,
I changed the code to retrieve from a known location. In this case, from
the component's repo location. And then using a raw github fetch to 
acquire the WASM file. That does not work, error is:

```
TypeError: Failed to execute 'compile' on 'WebAssembly': Incorrect response MIME type. Expected 'application/wasm'.
```

Here is a discussion of the issue:

## Using tiny go

Link: https://tinygo.org/docs/guides/webassembly/wasm/

Command:

```
tinygo build -o wasm.wasm -target wasm ./main.go
```

Results: 
- go wasm size was 2788448
- tinygo size was   900648
